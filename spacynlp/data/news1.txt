"Notre Dame is an 850-year-old lady," the rector of Notre Dame, Patrick Chauvet, told me. "She's an injured, old lady."

"And for all the elderly, the injured, those in quarantine, or isolated in retirement homes, I think there's a symbolic link. There's no-one around Notre Dame here either; she's has been left alone, but not abandoned."

In the late afternoon of 15 April 2019, Monseigneur Chauvet was enjoying a drink at a nearby cafe when smoke began rising from the spire of Notre Dame.

For a few critical hours, firefighters warned the French president that Notre Dame might not be saved.

Claudine Loisel, a glass specialist working on the restoration, has been painstakingly testing the lead and grime on each panel of the building's 19th Century stained-glass windows, to check it's safe for restorers to begin their work.

She told a BBC4 TV documentary, Rebuilding Notre Dame, that some of the windows there had not been cleaned for a century, and that dirt may have helped save them from lead contamination in the fire.

Researchers from the Centre for National Scientific Research (CNRS) in Paris are creating a digital model of every stone and rafter, to help with the restoration work.
